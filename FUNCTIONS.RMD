1. Creating tables   
   CREATE TABLE customers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER, weight REAL)   
   CREATE TABLE customers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, age INTEGER); Using primary keys
  
2. Inserting data   
  INSERT INTO customers VALUES (73, "Brian", 33)   
  INSERT INTO customers (name, age) VALUES ("Brian", 33)
  
3. Querying data    
  SELECT * FROM customers;  (everything)     
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 21; (condition)   
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age < 21 AND state = "NY";  (multiple condition)   
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE plan IN ("free", "basic"); (IN condition)   
  SELECT name, age FROM customers; (specific column)   
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 21 ORDER BY age DESC; (order)       
  SELECT name, CASE WHEN age > 18 THEN "adult" ELSE "minor" END "type" FROM customers;  (different cases)   
  
4. Aggregating data   
  SELECT MAX(age) FROM customers;  (maximum)   
  SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY gender;  (count)   
  
5. Joining related tables    
  SELECT customers.name, orders.item FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id; (inner join-intersection)    
  SELECT customers.name, orders.item FROM customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id; (outer join-union)   
  
6. Updating and deleting data   
  UPDATE customers SET age = 33 WHERE id = 73;  (update)   
  DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 73;  (delete)   
  
7. LEFT/RIGHT   
   Extract number of characters from left/right   
   *format LEFT/RIGHT('string',num_characters)* 
 
8. POSITION/STRPOS   
   Find the position of a string   
   **POSITION(',' IN city_state)**   
   **STRPOS('city_state',',')**   
   
9. CONCAT/||
   Combine two strings
   **CONCAT('string','string')**
   **'string' || 'string'**
   
10.DATE_TRUNC()/DATE_PART()
   Extract part of the date
   **DATE_TRUNC(‘day’, time_column)**
   **DATE_PART(year, '2017/08/25')**
